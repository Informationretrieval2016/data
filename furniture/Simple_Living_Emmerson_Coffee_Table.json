    "Love this table. I was very pleased with the quality and beauty of the wood. For the price, this can't be beat.", 
    "easily put together in about 30 min", 
    "The 4 stars is really a 5 but because the description is not 100% accurate, I could only do 4 stars. The frame is BLACK. There is no dark brown to it. The easiest piece of furniture I ever assembled and it is packed really well. Took me as long to remove it from the carton as it did to put it together. About 10 minutes total and 5 minute assembly!! It's a beautiful piece of furniture at a great price!!"
