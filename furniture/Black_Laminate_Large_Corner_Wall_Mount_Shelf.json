    "We bought these shelves for my sons room. Upon arrival my husband had no problem putting the pieces together though some of the boards were slightly warped. Also the screw holes were drilled to big so my husband needed to get some different anchors and figure out a way to get the screws to work within the too big holes and get the shelve secured to the wall. Not worth what we paid for it but it does look nice up. Just poor quality.",

    "Smaller than I expected, but still worth the price", 
    "Quality control failed with this item. The screw holes do not match and several shelves will not hold once screws used to put item together. I had to resort to using stronger/wider screws and liquid nails. I would not put anything of value or heavy on the shelves. I bought for daughter who displays pictures and memorabilia on it.

Also, be aware that the little inserts to cover the screws do NOT stay on.Also, unless you have PERFECTLY straight walls the shelves will NOT go against the walls and stay with only the two screw areas provided. They do not align straight and the shelves are not level.",

    "haven't hung them yet. still in the box. ask me later"
