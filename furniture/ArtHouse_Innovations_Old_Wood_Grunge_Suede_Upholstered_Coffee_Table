Made of wood and suede, this upholstered coffee table has a durable design and unique style that gives your home a contemporary feel. The table has a permanent waterproof adhesive between the wooden top and suede fabric, so the fabric will not buckle over time or when spot cleaned. Made for indoor use, this table's design will not fade if exposed to direct sunlight for 24 hours a day. This table is made with the same process that professional casino gaming tables use to upholster tables you find at the casino.Shape: RectangleType: Coffee Tables, Accent TablesStyle: Contemporary, ModernMaterial: Upholstered, Wood, SuedeAssembly: Assembly RequiredFinish: MatteColor: BrownStyleContemporary, ModernMaterialSuede, Upholstered, WoodTypeAccent Tables, Coffee TablesFinishMatteShapeRectangleAssemblyAssembly RequiredColorBrownProduct FeaturesMade in USA
