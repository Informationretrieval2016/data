    "very nice quality, very happy with the choice", 
    "This is a tad wobbly - we have a super thick shag rug so it's a bit more stable but I wouldn't want this on a hard wood floor. Does look nice, probably will need some clear rubber stickers etc. to hold the glass in place a bit better. I'd buy again though, nice table."
