    "These shelves are great, I ordered several sets for my living room. It says not to use a drill, but we did anyway in order to get the anchors in the wall. The installation instructions aren't very good but it doesn't take a genius to figure out how to install the shelves. They're stable and look good.", 
    "Great little shelve's. SO easy to put up. Not too deep though. I put up my 4 inch potted plant's on some and, my new salt and pepper grinder's on another. They are usefull and, they look great also.", 
    "They are exactly what I expected and wanted - affordable, nice looking, functional for my purposes. I have a very small bathroom, and small cabinets and closets. I can never get to one product without knocking a million others over. In addition, I have a lot of wallspace behind two bathroom doors. I bought 4 sets of these shelves, and hung them all over that wallspace. They are mostly hidden, since the doors are always open against the wall. They're thin enough to fit back there. I have *all* my products on them - hair products, perfumes, lotions, deodorants, skincare, etc. and I love them. The only negative is the hardware they came with - they were cheap. We had to buy some good wall anchor screws at the hardware store to really secure them to the walls (where there are no studs).", 
    "These are so perfect for any decor. They are MUCH smaller than I had expected, but they worked perfectly on the empty wall in our bedroom. The white is a very bright white and the shelves are sturdy. Very happy with my purchase and will probably by more!", 
    "Great little shelves for the price! If you have small spaces that need a little fun, these are what you're looking for!", 
    "These shelves are okay, but not really what I wanted. I am using them but not where I had planned. They are small and cheap looking...but the price is quite low.", 
    "I needed some shelves for our bathroom and these are great. Not great quality but you can't tell once they are hung up. I discarded the cheap wall anchors supplied and used some good ones so the shelves will stay up. Now that they're in place they hold all the shaving supplies including straight razor and brush and soaps. They look super on display.", 
    "These are okay shelves (look like picture) but do not use the hardware that comes with them. The anchor kits are cheap and horrible. They kept going through the wall (as in all the way into the wall) and the screws would not hold. Use your own anchor kits and shelves should hang fine.", 
    "Horrible instructions, impossible to put up.", 
    "Not what I really needed. Used in bathroom added wood bars to front. Excellent quality.", 
    "These we're pretty straightforward, and finished off the collage on my wall.", 
    "Like the look, will know more about hanging them when I finish but so far so good", 
    "Very easy to put up, very sturdy", 
    "Good for small spaces. Nice for the walls in stair cases.", 
    "Simply wood painted white. No style, just plain", 
    "these are great . very easy to put up and dont fall of when you move stuff.", 
    "Nice wall unit I'm happy w purchase", 
    "just perfect for what i needed", 
    "Looks good, but shelves are too shallow to provide real storage. A few accents are about all they can hold. Aesthetics only.", 
    "I had wanted to use these as pedestals to display some ceramics, but they are NOT drilled to be installed in the inverted position as was stated in the description! The finish was acceptable, I had ordered the white ones. I returned them.", 
    "These are being used in my dining room for some decorative items. For the price I think they're great. They are not very deep so they are only for holding smaller items. They are also not amazing quality and the \"template\" to help you drill the holes in the right place on your wall is \"slightly\" off. Overall they work well for the price.", 
    "It was good. I liked it.", 
    "can be hung in various ways and I like that a lot", 
    "These are not the best quality. But ok for my extra bathroom.",

    "Easy installation and perfect for any room.", 
    "I absolutely love it! They look awesome on m wall", 
    "The shelves look just like in pictures, nice material regards to the price. The anchor didn't really fit in the wall but you can just hammered it in. However there's a defect on the smallest shelf. The screw can't slide through one of the hole on the back of the shelf, so we had to readjust it a little and it most likely won't hold anything heavy at all as it will tilt the shelf. These serve their purposes (decoration), no major complaint.", 
    "Perfect for displaying items.", 
    "bought the white set for my daughters room and they were so easy to put up and look amazing!!!", 
    "fast shipping and very good seller", 
    "These shelves were not too difficult to install. You know measure twice drill once. Make sure you have a level and you might want to get some better mounting hardware, the stuff that comes with it is ok if its straight wood but wallboard your need beefier toggles.", 
    "Good price, east to install.", 
    "Love them, fit perfectly in my apartment", 
    "Ordered white shelves got dark ones. I called and Overstock reordered them in white and I got dark again. I kept both sets and painted them Overstock, don't advertise what you don't have.",

    "Great little accent on a narrow wall, simple to hang.", 
    "These are a huge disappointment. Cheap craftsmanship.", 
    "Pretty good quality, however they are not as long as they look in the pictures. I suggest looking at the dimensions so you know the exact length of each before buying. Still nice shelves and if dimensions work, definately worth the buy. Looks great in my bathroom.", 
    "These are nice accent shelves; they are attractive and interesting on the wall.", 
    "Love this product, good price and good quality!!!", 
    "Perfect for those things you want to display but don't want a toddler knocking off the shelves that they can climb or worry about a bookcase toppling.",

    "Put them over my office credenza and they look great. Fill a 36 inch space nicely",

    "I truly love this piece of art it brings out beauty in my living room.",

    "Good deal! Happy to discover the great deals at Overstock.com!", 
    "Although the shelves are lovely, they are extremely difficult (close to impossible) to mount. The mounting devices fall into the wall whenwe tried to put the shelves up. This is totally unacceptable. If my husband was not as handy as he is, I would have sent it all back.He had to improvise a hanging system to get the shelves on the wall.", 
    "Hi. I purchased these shelves for my daughter's room and have been very happy. They were easy to install (thanks to a handy measuring 'tape' included with the directions) and have held up well. Definitely a good buy.", 
    "These are perfect to store and display my face cream and makeup brushes (in attractive glass containers) on the wall in a bathroom with no medicine cabinet. Not very wide, so I couldn't fit my orchid plant so I had to figure out something else for that, but otherwise a great solution!",

    "Great product. Priced accurate and performs as advertised.", 
    "Great product...however I hoped to have used the product non U shaped but the grooves for the screws are only designed for a U shaped hold. I still managed to use the shelves, not how I wanted but it was still functional. I would recommend to others but dont try to use upside down.",

They only took a few moments to hang and look terrific, just be aware they are not very deep and only suitable for small items. I have some 1930's cups and saucers that look perfect and I am very happy with the product and the reasonable pricing.",

    "Excellent addition to my \"man cave\" walls. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Shelves are much smaller than I expected, although site description was correct when I looked back to check. Good quality, made for a smaller wall than I planned on hanging them on!", 
    "Need a drill to create hole for screw sheath for actual screw.", 
    "Looks better on line than in real life. I would not recommend this item", 
    "The Floating Shelves is what I was looking for \"they are Great\"", 
    "The shelves are awesome! They look beautiful. I was confused hanging them because the instructions didn't have any words, just pictures.", 
    "I wanted these 3 shelves to stand battery operated candles in a dark stairwell. They worked perfectly.", 
    "Decent quality for the price, dont expect solid wood construction. Light weight hollow core, easy to install and secure to the wall, dont put abything heavy on it, unless the you use a stud finder and secure the mounting screws directly to some wood. Its just common sense that any shelves mounted on to sheet rock and not the studs behind is very limited in holding power.", 
    "The shelves are a pressed wood with a fake dark print of wood grain, so I was disappointed with them at first. However, I decided to hang them anyway and they look really good on the wall.", 
    "These shelves look much nicer in person than the picture shows. I just love them. THey are sturdy and look fabulous against my grey/blue walls. Very happy with these. The price is phenomenal - I expected a lower quality at this price - but they are actually very good quality.", 
    "Bought three sets of these shelves to display pictures in an empty nook. Used the smallest shelves for a some accessories. Turned out beautifully and I have received lots of compliments on it. Very pleased with the product.",

    "These shelves were very easy to assemble. I would by them again.", 
    "Good shelves for the money. up close they look cheap but I put them high on a tall wall and they serve the purpose just fine", 
    "Very sturdy, and simple to put put up. Can be put different ways for different looks, which is great.", 
    "The shelves look really good above the bed. We actually are using the bottom two (the smaller ones) for keeping our cellphones, watches etc. while sleeping, and the top one holds pictures. They add character to the room. They were delivered in time, and were easy to mount, modulo some amount of drilling and hammering through the walls.", 
    "I needed something that added character to my wall and these did just that. Perfect for small light books and items as they are not very deep."
